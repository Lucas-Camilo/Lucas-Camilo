- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lucas-Camilo
- 👀 I'm interested in always learning something new every day.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Java and C#, and I'm always learning something new in other languages.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that need a helping hand to learn python.
- 📫 how to reach me: just needing help and calling me.
